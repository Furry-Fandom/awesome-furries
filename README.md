## Contribution Guidelines

* **Do** feel free to suggest people who have done meaningful good for
  the community (or for the world).
  * We want to highlight people who that do good things!
  * Having agreeable Twitter hot takes (and nothing further) doesn't count.
* Don't just suggest popular people because they're popular!
* Posthumuous entries are fine. (Make sure their closest friends
  or family review your word choice!)
