# Contributing

To propose an additional furry to this list, create a pull request
with the following changes:

1. Create a Markdown file somewhere inside `furries/`.
2. Create an appropriate, congruent entry inside `index.json`.
3. (Optional) Run `bin/build-readme.php` locally to rebuild the
   README file.

## Contribution Guidelines

* **Do** feel free to suggest people who have done meaningful good for
  the community (or for the world).
  * We want to highlight people who that do good things!
  * Having agreeable Twitter hot takes (and nothing further) doesn't count.
* Don't just suggest popular people because they're popular!
* Posthumuous entries are fine. (Make sure their closest friends
  or family review your word choice!)
